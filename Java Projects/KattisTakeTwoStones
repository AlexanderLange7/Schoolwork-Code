/*
Alice and Bob are playing a new game of stones. There are NN stones placed on the ground, forming a sequence. 
The stones are labeled from 1 to N.
Alice and Bob in turns take exactly two consecutive stones on the ground until there are no consecutive 
stones on the ground. That is, each player can take stone i and stone i+1, where 1≤i≤N−1
If the number of stone left is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.
Assume both Alice and Bob play optimally and Alice plays first, do you know who the winner is?

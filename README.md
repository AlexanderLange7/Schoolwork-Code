# Schoolwork-Code
There are many examples of work I've done through UG studies found in this repository. One of the main reasons I am developing this repository is to give potential employers a decent example of what I've learned throughout my UG studies. It also allows me to reflect on my progress into software development so far.  That's pretty much it.

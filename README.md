# Schoolwork-Code
There are many examples of work I've done through UG studies found in this repository. One of the main reasons I am developing this repository is to give potential employers a decent example of what I've learned throughout my UG studies. It also allows me to reflect on my progress into software development so far.  That's pretty much it.

Oh yeah, and the Java Projects and C# Projects are all text files, because I would read over the practice problems, but Kattis keeps the submission code, so I just threw text files down instead of taking time to put them in .java and .cs files. So the language percentage calculator for this repo is way off. Be forewarned!
